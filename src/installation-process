h1. Installation process

Joobsbox comes bundled with an intuitive, 3 steps installer.

h2. Step 1

This is the most complex step. Here you need to provide the common title for all your Joobsbox site pages. For example, if you had your common title "Nobody without a job", then all pages in your site would feature this as their last chunk (the publish page's title would look like "Publish - Nobody without a job").

h3. Joobsbox needs a database

This is a tricky part that could bring trouble to the unexperienced. You have to set up a database for Joobsbox to store its data in it. This is usually done using your host's control/admin panel under the databases section. 

h3. What happens if your host only allows you one database

Joobsbox thought about that, and you will thoughtfully tell it to use a table prefix so you can distinguish them from other applications' tables. This way they won't overwrite each other.

h3. Database information required by Joobsbox to connect

Joobsbox connects to the database server in the background. Yet stil, it needs proper credentials so that the server will satisfy its requests. The following information is required:

* database name
* connection username
* connection password
* database server address

The connection username and password must be a correct combination for a user that can connect to the database you specified in the database name field. 
The database server address is "localhost" most of the times. However, there are some hosts that require you to specify otherwise. Please refer to your hosts' documentation for more information.

h3. The table prefix

This can be set to something like "jbs_" if you need it. 

h2. Step 2

If you passed step 1, step 2 is a welcoming screen that creates an administration user for you.

h2. Step 3

There's no step 3 really. This only tells you that you're done! Congrats!

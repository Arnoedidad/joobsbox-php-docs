h1. Deploying Joobsbox PHP to your server

h2. Deploying the files (method 1 - FTP approach)

To deploy Joobsbox PHP to your UNIX based server, download the package to your machine and unpack it. 

Create a new domain/subdomain for your fresh Joobsbox installation and log in to FTP in order to upload Joobsbox PHP files.

Upload the Joobsbox PHP files inside the directory you unpacked.

Some files and folders need to be written by Joobsbox at certain points. Because of this, they need to have write permissions. You can set permissions per files and folders using your favourite FTP client software (example: Filezilla). Give write permissions to the following files and folders:
* config/
* config/config.ini.php
* cache/
* Joobsbox/SearchIndexes

** @chmod +x install.bash@
** @./install.bash@

h1. Translating Joobsbox PHP

This is one of the easiest things and a cool feature of Joobsbox PHP. Joobsbox PHP uses gettext files for translations. This technology is an industry standard and is used among many very popular open-source software. 

h2. How does it work

A translation source consists of two files: the source (.po) and the compiled file (.mo). A source file looks like the following:

p(source). #: Controllers/CategoryController.php:38
msgid "This category does not exist."
msgstr "This category does not exist."

p(source). #: Controllers/JobController.php:33
msgid "The requested job does not exist!"
msgstr "The requested job does not exist!"

The .mo file is compiled using software like poEdit.

h2. How you can help

Joobsbox PHP translations can be done online using the popular web application Rosetta from Canonical's Launchpad. 
Go to "Joobsbox Translations in Launchpad":https://translations.launchpad.net/joobsbox and start translating into your own language. 

h2. The cool part

In Launchpad, you can translate everything right there, using using your browser. If you don't know how to translate a string, just leave it out or suggest a translation and it will be reviewed by someone else.

	<h1>Installation process</h1>

	<p>Joobsbox comes bundled with an intuitive, 3 steps installer.</p>

	<h2>Step 1</h2>

	<p>This is the most complex step. Here you need to provide the common title for all your Joobsbox site pages. For example, if you had your common title &#8220;Nobody without a job&#8221;, then all pages in your site would feature this as their last chunk (the publish page&#8217;s title would look like &#8220;Publish &#8211; Nobody without a job&#8221;).</p>

	<h3>Joobsbox needs a database</h3>

	<p>This is a tricky part that could bring trouble to the unexperienced. You have to set up a database for Joobsbox to store its data in it. This is usually done using your host&#8217;s control/admin panel under the databases section. </p>

	<h3>What happens if your host only allows you one database</h3>

	<p>Joobsbox thought about that, and you will thoughtfully tell it to use a table prefix so you can distinguish them from other applications&#8217; tables. This way they won&#8217;t overwrite each other.</p>

	<h3>Database information required by Joobsbox to connect</h3>

	<p>Joobsbox connects to the database server in the background. Yet stil, it needs proper credentials so that the server will satisfy its requests. The following information is required:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>database name</li>
		<li>connection username</li>
		<li>connection password</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>database server address</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The connection username and password must be a correct combination for a user that can connect to the database you specified in the database name field. <br />
The database server address is &#8220;localhost&#8221; most of the times. However, there are some hosts that require you to specify otherwise. Please refer to your hosts&#8217; documentation for more information.</p>

	<h3>The table prefix</h3>

	<p>This can be set to something like &#8220;jbs_&#8221; if you need it. </p>

	<h2>Step 2</h2>

	<p>If you passed step 1, step 2 is a welcoming screen that creates an administration user for you.</p>

	<h2>Step 3</h2>

	<p>There&#8217;s no step 3 really. This only tells you that you&#8217;re done! Congrats!</p>

	<h2>Deploying the files (method 1 &#8211; <span class="caps">FTP</span> approach)</h2>

	<p>To deploy Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span> to your <span class="caps">UNIX</span> based server, download the package to your machine and unpack it. </p>

	<p>Create a new domain/subdomain for your fresh Joobsbox installation and log in to <span class="caps">FTP</span> in order to upload Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span> files.</p>

	<p>Upload the Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span> files inside the directory you unpacked.</p>

	<p>Some files and folders need to be written by Joobsbox at certain points. Because of this, they need to have write permissions. You can set permissions per files and folders using your favourite <span class="caps">FTP</span> client software (example: Filezilla). Give write permissions to the following files and folders:
	<ul>
		<li>config/</li>
		<li>config/config.ini.php</li>
		<li>cache/</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Joobsbox/SearchIndexes</li>
	</ul></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Connect to your server through <span class="caps">SSH</span></li>
		<li>Go to the directory where you want to store Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span> files
		<li>Type the following:
	<ul>

	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>You&#8217;re set</li>
	</ul>

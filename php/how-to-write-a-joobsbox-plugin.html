	<h1>How to write a Joobsbox plugin</h1>

	<p>You want to extend Joobsbox with some fancy functionality but you don&#8217;t intend to dive into the core of the application? No problemo! That&#8217;s why Joobsbox gives you plugins to extend its functionality. Below you can find out how to create such a plugin.</p>

	<h2>The plugin architecture</h2>

	<p>While doing its job, Joobsbox raises some flags from time to time. These flags are called events. When this happens, it also looks for plugins that care about these flags and invites them to stage to perform their action. Here&#8217;s an example:
	<ul>
		<li>Joobsbox homepage requests the available jobs from the database boss</li>
		<li>When it receives these jobs, it raises a flag: &#8220;received_jobs&#8221;</li>
		<li>It then calls each plugin that has eyes for this event. This is done by simply defining a method called &#8220;event_received_jobs&#8221;. </li>
		<li>Each plugin has its moment of glory</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Joobsbox continues normal operation and shows the jobs</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Each plugin defines <strong>event handlers</strong> or <strong>filters</strong> that get executed when a flag is raised.</p>

	<h2>Events vs filters</h2>

	<p>Joobsbox features two flavours of plugin related functionality. Above you&#8217;ve seen how an event works. Joobsbox doesn&#8217;t expect an <strong>event handler</strong> to return anything. However, there is a special type of handlers called filters. A filter is given some pieces of information and is then expected to return it. It&#8217;s each plugin&#8217;s job to take care about that data.</p>

	<p><span class="important">All plugins that implement a certain filter will <strong>chain</strong>. This means that the first plugin&#8217;s returned data will be fed to the next plugin that implements that functionality.</span></p>

	<h2>Creating a new plugin</h2>

	<p>To create a plugin, make a new folder in <span class="dir">plugins/</span> starting with a capital letter and named uniquely as your plugin name.</p>

	<h3>Let&#8217;s create the plugin</h3>

	<p>For the sake of simplicity, we&#8217;ll use an example plugin named <em>Hello</em> plugin, the simplest Joobsbox plugin in the world. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Create the folder <span class="dir">plugins/Hello</span></li>
		<li>Create a php file called <span class="file">Hello.php</span> in this folder.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Open <span class="file">Hello.php</span> in your favourite source code editor</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This file needs to contain your plugin class called Hello, just as the plugin name, plugin folder and plugin file <span class="smile">&nbsp;</span>. This class needs to extend the core class Joobsbox_Plugin_Base. You&#8217;ll find out what magic happens by extending this class.<br />
That&#8217;s it! You have a plugin. Now you have to teach it to watch the flags. In order to decide the precise moment your plugin is going to stage to perform, consult the <a href="list-of-events-and-filters">list of events and filters</a>.<br />
Again for the sake of example, we&#8217;ll consider a filter and an event. </p>

	<p>The event: <strong>received_jobs</strong><br />
This flag gets raised when the homepage receives the jobs from the Jobs model. To create an event handler, you need to define a function called quite imaginatively <strong>event_received_jobs</strong>. From now on, every time the homepage is loaded, your plugin&#8217;s _received_jobs_ event handler will get executed.</p>

	<p>The filter: <strong>job_description</strong><br />
This filter is requested every time a job description needs to be displayed. A common place for this to happen is the job detail page. This filter for example sends the job description string as a parameter to your function. Your plugin filter function will then make modifications to the string and return it. </p>

	<p><span class="important">Pay special attention to the way the function filter returns the data it received. It needs to be returned inside an array.</span></p>

	<p>Whether your function receives 1 or 10 arguments, they need to be returned in an array, ordered exactly the same as they were received. This is because, as mentioned above, filter functions from different plugins chain.</p>

	<h2>What magic happens by extending _Joobsbox_Plugin_Base_</h2>

	<h3>Plugin data storage </h3>

	<p>Simple means of storing data in the database, as key-value pairs. You can store text data that only your plugin can read and write. This can be done by using the following functions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>addConfiguration($key, $value)</code></li>
		<li><code>getConfiguration($key)</code> // retrieves the value that coresponds to $key</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><code>deleteConfigurationByName($key)</code> // deletes the entry that corresponds to $key</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Get easy access to Joobsbox models</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><code>getModel($name)</code></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Get easy access to Joobsbox helpers</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;_helper-&#62;MakeLink(&#39;something that has to get formatted as a link&#39;)</code> for example</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Admin plugins</h2>

	<p>Simple plugins and admin plugins share the same <span class="dir">plugins/</span> folder and the same magic mentioned above. However, admin plugins are something a little more advanced. They get an entry into the admin panel&#8217;s menu, and, if they want, they can also show up in the dashboard on the admin panel home page.</p>

	<h3>The configuration file</h3>

	<p>Each admin plugin has to set up a <span class="file">config.ini.php</span> of its own. If <em>Hello</em> plugin were an admin plugin, it would have to provide Joobsbox with the file <span class="file">plugins/Hello/config.ini.php</span>. This file needs to have the following format:</p>

	<p><code>[main]</code><br />
<code>title_en			=	Hello title</code><br />
<code>image				=	images/hello_24.png</code></p>

	<p>What this does is that it sets the plugin title both in the admin panel menu and dashboard. The directive title_$lang is there to set up the title for different languages. You could for example set up title_fr for the French title.</p>

	<h3>Appearing on the Dashboard</h3>

	<p>In order for a plugin to appear on the dashboard, it has to implement the function <strong>dashboard()</strong> and also have a dashboard view script, located in <span class="file">Hello/views/dashboard.phtml</span>.</p>

	<h3>Magic inherits</h3>

	<p>Each admin plugin features a few variables and methods that save lives. The view scripts have the following methods and variables:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;pluginUrl</code> gives you the url at which the plugin is being loaded. You can use this to build links</li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;translate</code> Joobsox plugins are given the godsend of gettext translations. They must have the <span class="dir">languages/</span> folder which has to contain the gettext files for the current locale setting.</li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;themeUrl</code> is the current theme&#8217;s url &#8211; useful for building links to css, js or image files in the current theme.</li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;baseUrl</code> is Joobsbox base url &#8211; if it was installed under <em>yourdomain.com/apps/joobsbox</em> for example, the <strong>baseUrl</strong> would be &#8220;apps/joobsbox&#8221;</li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;publicUrl</code> is the public folder&#8217;s url &#8211; useful for loading js, css and other stuff located in <span class="dir">public/</span></li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;asset</code> is a special asset loader for view scripts &#8211; check out <a href="the-asset-loader">The Asset Loader</a> to see what can it do for you</li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;conf</code> links you to a Zend_Config_Ini object that has loaded <span class="file">config/config.ini.php</span> in a directly accessible object. Example usage: <code>$this-&#62;conf-&#62;main-&#62;common_title</code></li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;headScript()</code> Zend_View method for loading javascript files</li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;headMeta()</code> Zend_View method for adding meta tags to head</li>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;headLink()</code> Zend_View method for adding <link> tags &#8211; load <span class="caps">CSS</span> files through this</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;headTitle()</code> Zend_View method for working with the page title</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Methods and variables accessible in the plugin class:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>$this-&#62;_helper</code> provides access to Joobsbox helpers</li>
	</ul>

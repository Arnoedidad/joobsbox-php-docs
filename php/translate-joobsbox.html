	<h1>Translating Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span></h1>

	<p>This is one of the easiest things and a cool feature of Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span>. Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span> uses gettext files for translations. This technology is an industry standard and is used among many very popular open-source software. </p>

	<h2>How does it work</h2>

	<p>A translation source consists of two files: the source (.po) and the compiled file (.mo). A source file looks like the following:</p>

	<p class="source">#: Controllers/CategoryController.php:38<br />
msgid &#8220;This category does not exist.&#8221;<br />
msgstr &#8220;This category does not exist.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="source">#: Controllers/JobController.php:33<br />
msgid &#8220;The requested job does not exist!&#8221;<br />
msgstr &#8220;The requested job does not exist!&#8221;</p>

	<p>The .mo file is compiled using software like poEdit.</p>

	<h2>How you can help</h2>

	<p>Joobsbox <span class="caps">PHP</span> translations can be done online using the popular web application Rosetta from Canonical&#8217;s Launchpad. <br />
Go to <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/joobsbox">Joobsbox Translations in Launchpad</a> and start translating into your own language. </p>

	<h2>The cool part</h2>

	<p>In Launchpad, you can translate everything right there, using using your browser. If you don&#8217;t know how to translate a string, just leave it out or suggest a translation and it will be reviewed by someone else.</p>
